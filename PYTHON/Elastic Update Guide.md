# Python Script for Automatic Elasticsearch Update

This guide describes how to use the provided Python script for automatically updating Elasticsearch to the latest version.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3 and `pip` should be installed on your system.
- The `requests` library is required. Install it using `pip install requests` if it's not already installed.
- Elasticsearch should be already installed.
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to run system updates and install packages.

## Usage

1. **Save the Script**: Save the provided script as `updateelastic.py`.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   If you haven't already, install the `requests` library:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Grant execution permission to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x updateelastic.py
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script by running:
   ```bash
   ./updateelastic.py
   ```

The script will fetch the latest version of Elasticsearch from the official website and compare it with the installed version. If an update is available, it will proceed to update Elasticsearch.
